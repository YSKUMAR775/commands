# start MySql server on windows using command prompt for windows.
"C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin\mysqld" --console

	The path in this command is the default installation folder. In case you have installed MySQL in a different folder, the command needs to reflect that to launch the mysqld executable file successfully.
The --console option displays output directly on your console. Omitting this option sends the output directly to the MySQL logs.


# stop MySql server on windows using command prompt for windows.
 

	The mysqladmin tool performs the shutdown command and fully stops the MySQL server.
The system does not provide output as confirmation.

create table user(id int(11) unsigned auto_increment primary key not null,username varchar(25) not null,password varchar(25) not null,email varchar(40) not null);  # to determine what parameters my table will have (here i only created empty parameters)

insert into user(username,password,email)
values('kumar', '123', 'yskumar775@gmail.com');  # use single quotes bcz double quotes won't work in MySql

select * from user;  # here * represents everything 

insert into user(username,password,email) values('navin', '456', 'navin@gmail.com');
